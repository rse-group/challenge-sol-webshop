# UML-DOP Diagrams

This branch contains the **UML-DOP diagrams** used to model the backend structure of the **Webshop Product Line**.

## Contents

This branch provides UML-DOP diagrams for each feature in the Webshop Product Line. These diagrams serve as the input for the **UML to WinVMJ** tool, which converts them into Java-based core and delta modules. Instructions for using the tool can be found in the user manual in the [`main`](https://github.com/rse-group/splc25-microservice-to-spl-artifact) branch.
