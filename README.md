# ⚙️ Generated Products

This branch contains **generated source code** for different webshop products, built using our solution tools.

## 🛍️ Subject Systems

The generated products are based on:
- **eShopOnContainers**
- **Hipster Shop**
- **Sock Shop**
- **Stan’s Robot Shop**

Each product consists of:
- **Backend source code** (based on VMJ)
- **Frontend source code** (React application)
- `services-def.json`: A microservice configuration file that defines the configuration of each service.

These products demonstrate the configurability and variability handled by our SPL infrastructure.
