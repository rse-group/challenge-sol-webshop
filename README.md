# ‚öôÔ∏è Generated Products

This branch contains **generated source code** for different webshop products, built using our solution tools.

## üõçÔ∏è Subject Systems

The generated products are based on:
- [**eShopOnContainers**](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers)
- [**Hipster Shop**](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers)
- [**Sock Shop**](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo)
- [**Stan‚Äôs Robot Shop**](https://github.com/instana/robot-shop)

Each product consists of:
- **Backend source code** (based on VMJ)
- **Frontend source code** (React application)
- `services-def.json`: A microservice configuration file that defines the configuration of each service.

These products demonstrate the configurability and variability handled by our SPL infrastructure.
