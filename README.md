# ðŸ§© WinVMJ Project

This branch contains the **WinVMJ project**, which represents the backend variability model for the **Webshop Product Line**.

It includes:
- **FeatureIDE-compatible project structure**
- **Core and delta modules for multiple features**
- **Configuration files for product derivation**
- **Seeding data for each subject system**, corresponding to the products in the [`generated-product`](https://github.com/rse-group/splc25-microservice-to-spl-artifact/tree/generated-product) branch

This branch also includes the **Payment Gateway Product Line**, which is used by the Webshop Product Line via the **multi-product line** concept to handle payment functionalities.

You can generate SPL products (backend only) from this project using the **WinVMJ Composer** tool. Instructions for doing so can be found in the user manual in the [`main`](https://github.com/rse-group/splc25-microservice-to-spl-artifact) branch.
