# IFML-DOP Diagrams

This branch includes the **IFML-DOP diagrams** that define the UI modeling aspects of the Webshop Product Line.

## Contents

- **Feature-based UI models** using IFML notation
- Designed for compatibility with the IFML-DOP Editor and UI Generator

These diagrams are used to generate frontend source code (React applications) as part of the overall SPL solution. Instructions for designing IFML-DOP diagrams and using the UI Generator tool can be found in the user manual in the [`main`](https://github.com/rse-group/splc25-microservice-to-spl-artifact) branch.
